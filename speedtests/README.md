# Speed Tests

Various benchmarks\* of the network.

*\* We use the term "benchmark" loosely. Very few attempts were made to follow
good statistical methods such as getting multiple samples or ensuring tests were
made under the same conditions.*

## Devices

## Initial Google Fiber Network

Our original network setup was the provided Google Fiber network box sitting
next to the patch panel where the fiber line entered the apartment. Wired
connections to the bedrooms and living room run through the extra ports on the
provided network box.
